DormDash solves the problem of the lack of direct delivery services to student dorms and inability to pay with a CC for delivery. For example, if a student living in the Village at Vanderbilt wants to order from a restaurant like I Love Sushi at Elliston Place, they either have to walk a mile to pick up the food and pay with their CC, or use a third-party app that doesnâ€™t allow CC and direct delivery to their dorm room. DormDash addresses these issues by enabling other students to deliver food directly to dorm rooms, all while using CC, making the process faster and more convenient.

The scope of this project focuses primarily on the direct delivery service aspect, as VUDACS regulations on the CC are strict and requesting approval is a time consuming process. Our primary focus is on the Vanderbilt campus and surrounding ToN restaurants, (40 restaurants and 31 residential colleges), with plans to expand to other campuses across the U.S. in the future.
