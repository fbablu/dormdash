# DormDash  

DormDash addresses the lack of direct delivery services to student dorms and the inability to pay with Commodore Cash (CC) for food delivery. For instance, a student living in the Village at Vanderbilt who wants to order from I Love Sushi on Elliston Place either has to walk a mile to pick up their food and pay with CC, or use a third-party app that doesnâ€™t support CC or direct dorm delivery. DormDash solves this problem by enabling students to deliver food directly to dorm rooms, all while using CC, making the process faster, more convenient, and student-friendly.  

## Project Scope  
The focus of this project is on direct delivery services, as navigating Vanderbilt's strict VUDACS regulations for CC approval is a time-consuming process. Initially, DormDash will focus on Vanderbilt's campus and its surrounding ToN restaurants (40 restaurants and 31 residential colleges), with plans to expand to other campuses across the U.S. in the future.
